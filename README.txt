Hello there :) This is my first "Java project" as a student. 

This is my final project in a Java cours called "Java OOps" of my first year as student in "Android/Ios Developer" in a institute of Stockholm(STI) Sweden.

The project indid It is a game that I named "Crazy lucky dice"  

-I write this code using "Windows 10" and "Intellij"
-I used "Java 18 SDK" modul
-Is a Java code

If you want to see my "project code" in action just follow my instructions.
 
First you must "Extract the ZIP file" then open the extracted map with "Intellij". Then check in the "compiler configuration" that you have the "Java 18 SDK " selected. 
then you can run it! :)
